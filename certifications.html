													<a href="images/photo_bachelor_lilian.png" target="_blank" rel="external" class="image fit"><img src="images/photo_bachelor_lilian.png" alt="" /></a>
													<p>When I was 16 years old, I worked for one year as underage apprentice in logistics department at Toyota. Due of this amazing experince, I choose my bachelor course: Industrial Engineering!
					
														During this bachelor, I made two years of internship at Bosch Brazil and then an amazing experience happened, to live in Germany. In the year of 2018, I had my first exchange as intern in Corporate Logistics Department at Bosch. 
														
														The initial total time course was 5 years, but due of my exchange I had to expand for 6 years until complete it. 
														
														My bachelor thesis had an inspiration at Bosch environment, which I shared the inisghts and learnings when is necessary to reduce a product portfolio in the automotive aftermarket.  .</p>

													<a href="images/photo_mba_lilian.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external" class="image fit"><img src="images/photo_mba_lilian.jpg" alt="" /></a>
													<p> When the covid pandemic situation turned on, every environment became conducive for me to return to Brazil. During that hard time, I decided to redirect my career to the Data world. So I enrolled in the MBA of Data Science and Analytics. I could learn more about data analytics and machine learning techniques on a deeper level, which contributed to my data career.
					
														My MBA thesis had an inspiration at AB Inbev environment, which I shared the inisghts and learnings  regarding useful product metrics and user journeys analysis for admin access portal monitoring. </p>
